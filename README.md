## About

The current purpose of this repository is to maintain examples of algorithms
implemented in Python that I use when teaching Stockton University course
CSCI 4104 Data Structures & Algorithms II. Most of my examples are currently
maintained outside of git and GitHub, but I plan to slowly add them here.
